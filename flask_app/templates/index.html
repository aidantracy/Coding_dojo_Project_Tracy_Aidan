            <h3 class="mt-5">What is a creditor?</h3>
            <hr class="my-2">
            <p class="my-2">A creditor is the bank or the company that has agreed to lend you money. Normally, an
                application for credit is filled out and submitted by you, the debtor.
                The bank then reviews your credit application and determines based on your credit worthiness, to lend
                you (or not) a specified amount of money to help you make a purchase.
                This bank (e.g. Chase, Citibank, Capital One, a local credit union, etc.) then becomes the creditor and
                will show on your credit report reporting the amount they provided
                you as a limit, as well as: how much you may owe them (it can be $0), your payment history, credit
                utilization, historic high balance, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="my-2">But, what would happen if you owe a balance and you just stopped paying on it or you
                couldn't afford to pay on it anymore? Welcome to the world of debt collections.
                You have to understand, if the bank is worth their weight in salt, they wont immediately send you to
                debt collections. They perform what is called "internal collections."
                This is typically triggered by allowing your account to go from 1 day to 186 days past due. You will
                notice that you may start receiving numerous phone calls everyday.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-5">Why so many phone calls?</h5>
            <p class="my-2">This is a very common collection tactic. It's not the banks goal to harrass you (that is
                illegal!) but, to keep this debt
                fresh in your mind so that when you are paying bills, you will think about them. Seems counter intuitive
                because the phone calls can very easily be seen as an annoyance, however,
                this is a successful tactic and that is why it is still employed today. We are all human, we forget
                things. Especially if you are experiencing a hardship, your life may be busier
                than the average person's, hence it would be easy to forget about the debt.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-5">How do I stop these phone calls?</h5>
            <p class="my-2">Thankfully, we are protected as consumers to prevent harrassment from collection agencies
                including creditors. To stop these calls, the most effective way requires you to directly talk to the
                person calling you. In a nice and
                respectful, but firm tone, simply say "stop calling me." The law requires that they immediately stop.
                They may still mail you statements and collections correspondence to keep you up to date.
                However, this shouldn't be the last time you speak with them. You should, at least once a month, contact
                them and update them on your situation and try to work out a payment
                plan if you believe you owe the debt. Advising them to stop calling you will not erase your debt with
                them.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-5">They are asking for way too much! I just can't pay what they are asking for.
            </h5>
            <p class="my-2">Creditors understand this. Even if you think your account is a total loss and there is no
                way you
                can make a large payment that is way outside your budget, come up with a number that you know you can
                pay on a monthly basis.
                Call the creditor and let them know what you can do. You might be surprised with what they can offer!
                Dont be offended if you
                receive a counter offer for a monthly payment. That could be truly the best that they can do at the
                time. If you are unable to do that then
                you made need a professional to help you navigate your situation. Luckily, there are plenty of those out
                there!
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-5">Debt Settlement Agency vs Credit Counseling Agency</h5>
            <p class="my-2"> There seems to be a huge misunderstanding between these two types of companies. While
                seemingly
                similar, each has a completely different
                approach to credit card debt, loans, and even mortgages. Debt settlement agencies work towards just
                that, debt settlements. You pay them $x amount per
                account enrolled with them per month and in turn, they save up on your behalf and "negotiate" a
                settlement with your creditors and take a percentage for
                themselves. Unfortunately, in most people's situations this requires the creditor to <i>charge-off</i>
                the debt to a third-party debt collection agency. Something they
                dont tell you is that they usually never negotiate with creditors, even if the creditor sends a
                settlement offer. Why? Because they get more money that way by forcing the
                creditors hand to send it to a third party. Sounds like a win though right? Eh, depends. It usually
                trashes your credit as they keep the creditor in the dark. Sometimes, a
                creditor may choose to pursue the debt in court, the debt settlement agency, will not represent you in
                court. Not to mention the possible tax complications.
                You're on your own there. When it comes to these companies offering
                all these nice things about getting you out of your debt and you only paying for a portion of the
                balance. It may be too good to be true.
                A <strong>TON</strong> of research is required to see if they are actually a good fit for you. At which
                point, you
                may be better off negotiating a settlement by yourself.
            </p>
            <p class="my-3"> <i>Credit counseling groups</i> on the other hand are very much loved by creditors and are
                the recommended route by the government. These are typically non-profit
                organizations that will basically reach out to all your creditors on your behalf and see what they can
                offer in regards to a payment plan. They then
                report back to you to let you know what each creditor is willing to do, add up all the payments, add on
                a fee for their services (normally $10/account enrolled or similar). You
                then pay them the large payment every month and they disperse it amongst your creditors for a specified
                amount of time (normally 3-5 years). Again, you can also negotiate for yourself without them. Mainly, just have a good idea and stay true 
                to yourself of what you can afford on a monthly basis and just ask your creditor! 
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-5">What if I cant afford these options?</h5>
            <p class="my-2"> You may need a professional's help in this case. I would consider speaking with an attorney
                to explore
                the possibility of bankruptcy and how that would affect your credit. Especially if you are drowning in medical debt.
                If bankruptcy is a little extreme in the moment,
                you may try working side hustles to help supplement your income or to at least afford groceries (You should always put yourself first!) Please check out this <a href="/resources">resources</a>
