This is the final project I made for the Coding Dojo bootcamp. It covers and utilizes what we learned over the 28 weeks for the python stack.

The main purpose of this project was to help people understand how to manage past due credit cards if they had any. 

This project was kept in mind to help bridge the gap between my professional career in the financial sector as well as my professional career as a software engineer.
