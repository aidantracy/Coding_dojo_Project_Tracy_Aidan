                <p class="my-2"> One of the more popular sites amongst my clients. 211.org offers a variety of services
                    for people to get help from finding food, mental health help,
                    immigration help, and local charities. </p>

                <h5 class="my-2 mr-5">Balance Transfer</h5>
                <p class="my-2"> Some credit cards offer balance transfer promotions. Taking advantage of these offers
                    could land you with 0% interest for 12-18 months.
                    Payments are still required, but you are buying yourself another month or two before that payment is
                    due. Always read the fine print though.</p>

            <hr class="my-2">
            <div class="container d-flex align-items-center">
                <h5 class="my-2 mr-5">Consolidation Loans</h5>
                <p class="my-2"> Similar to balance transfers, consolidation loans are loans you apply for with a bank
                    or credit union that pays off your debt, then in turn you pay
                    the bank back what they paid your creditors. This option normally includes a hard credit pull, where
                    as the balance transfer option does not. It would be wise to get
                    a consolidation loan very early before anything goes past due if you dont have other means to pay
                    off your debt. Again, make sure to read the fine print!

            <div class="container d-flex align-items-center">
                <h5 class="my-2 mr-5">Defer Loans</h5>
                <p class="my-2"> A lot of people don't realize this is an option until maybe it's too late. Every
                    lender is different but it doesn't hurt to ask your lenders
                    if they are able to defer your payments for a few months or however long you may need. I
                    was personally successful with this approach and I like to recommend it to a lot of people. Let's
                    say
                    you have an autoloan that is $200-$400 per month. That's quite a big expense. Maybe you have an
                    income but can only afford just this loan payment and not your other debt obligations. Well
                    asking for deferment could free up that amount per month that you could use to catch up on other
                    obligations. You may take a interest hit on these loans but if you have past due
                    credit cards that are accruing interest and late fees on a monthly basis, this may make more
                    financial sense simply because credit card late fees are typically around $27-$42 per month
                    with an APR of usually in the high 20% range. Your interest rate on your loan is most likely well
                    below that APR alone. However, don't panic if your lenders decline your request. They may offer
                    something
                    else that may help remedy your situation such as a lower payment for several months or a lower APR!

                <h5 class="my-2 mr-5">Promo Checking Accounts</h5>
                <p class="my-2"> This is a good way to make your money work for you. It is very common nowadays for
                    banks to offer bonuses for opening checking accounts with them.
                    This is where you have to read the fine print in its entirety to understand how to earn their
                    promotion. You may see offers like "Get $300* when you open up a checking account*". <em> The asterisk
                    means things.</em> Usually, you have to set up a direct deposit (most employers offer this), or perform
                    an x-amount of transactions with your debit card every month, or have an $x amount of money in your
                    account at all times, etc. Tasks along those lines. Make sure, before you apply, that you understand
                    how this promotion works and set up a plan to earn this bonus! An hour of legwork and research may net you
                    couple hundred dollars in a few months. Only a few would say it's not worth it. I normally earn around $1000
                    every year doing this simply by just having my money deposited into different banks. If youre worried that you have to re-setup all your bills to come out of these
                    accounts, you can definitely do that. However, most banks offer electronic transfers to where you can transfer your money back to
                    you old account instead of redoing everything everytime.

                <h5 class="my-2 mr-5">Rideshares (Uber/Lyft)</h5>
                <p class="my-2"> This is a very underrated way of earning income and is not complicated at all. You
                    simply need a reliable vehicle. I recommend
                    looking up flight times and wait around the airports when the arrivals come in. You are just about
                    guaranteed to have a constant flow of business. If taxi driving
                    people around doesnt sound appealing, there is also Uber eats, Doordash, Postmates and GrubHub that
                    only
                    require you to pick up and deliver food! Easy Money. A vehicle is not necessarily required for the
                    food delivery. Some people use bikes, motor scooters, or even just walk if they are close enough.
                    Dont forget to add rideshare coverage through your auto insurance. Always protect yourself and your
                    guests!

                <p class="my-2"> This is a strong resource if you have the right mindset and you dont mind getting your
                    blood drawn.
                    Some of my clients have reported that they were able to catch up <em>very</em> quickly on their
                    delinquent debt obligations with this method. You are basically selling
                    your plasma to companies like <u>BioLife</u> and they use that to help save lives! It's a win-win!
                    The link will take you to Biolife's website. It is common for them to offer first
                    time donation bonuses in the range of $400 to $1000 for a specified amount of donations in the first
                    month.
